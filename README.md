# üß† chroma-agent-orchestrator

A lightweight multi-agent orchestration system using LLMs, JSON contracts, and service chaining with semantic discovery via ChromaDB.

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

This project demonstrates a **modular, AI-assisted orchestration system** for service execution and automation.

### üåê What it does  
It allows users‚Äîwhether human or machine‚Äîto express their goals in plain language. The system then:
1. **Understands the request** using a language model
2. **Identifies relevant backend services**
3. **Figures out what needs to run, in what order**
4. **Executes the services automatically**
5. **Returns the complete result, with full traceability**

Think of it as an **AI-powered dispatcher** that builds just-in-time service pipelines from natural language.

---

### üí° Why this matters

This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for:
- **Agentic systems** ‚Äî the future of automation and orchestration
- **LLM-enhanced backends** ‚Äî turning vague input into structured system behavior
- **Composable services** ‚Äî everything is defined by contracts, making reuse and chaining trivial
- **Intelligent observability** ‚Äî every step is logged and traceable

It enables **business logic composition at runtime**, rather than through pre-defined pipelines or hardcoded integrations.

---

### üìà Potential Use Cases
- **Customer Support**: Automatically trigger workflows based on customer messages
- **Sales Automation**: Assemble service responses based on intent ("Give me a leasing offer for an SUV")
- **DevOps**: Self-healing systems triggered by natural language alerts
- **Internal Tools**: Dynamic dashboards that reconfigure based on stakeholder prompts

---

### üß≠ Strategic Relevance

This prototype supports experimentation with:
- **Autonomous software agents**
- **Declarative backend composition**
- **Service governance via contracts**
- **AI-driven integration without traditional middleware**

It's aligned with modern trends in:
- **AI Ops & Developer Experience**
- **Composable Business Architectures**
- **Digital Transformation through ML-assisted orchestration**

## üß∞ Components

### 1. `coordinator_agent/`
The main orchestrator service. Handles:
- Query interpretation via LLM
- Dynamic JSON schema generation
- Topological sorting of services based on contract dependencies
- Service execution and response aggregation

#### Key files:
- `main.py`: The `/dispatch` endpoint, request routing, LLM-based extraction, and execution loop.
- `utils.py`: Everything from LLM prompting to contract validation, topo sorting, and logging.
- `requirements.txt`: FastAPI + requests + jsonschema.

### 2. `chroma-agents/`
Utility module for bootstrapping service definitions into ChromaDB.

#### Key files:
- `bootstrap_chroma.py`: Uploads JSON service definitions (with metadata + contracts) into Chroma.
- `*.json`: Service definition files (e.g., `customer.json`, `pricing.json`) including ID, description, endpoint, input/output contracts.
- `Dockerfile`: Runs the bootstrapper with required deps (`chromadb[server]`, `requests`).

### 3. `frontend/` (optional, stubbed)
Likely intended for visualization or user input. Currently has just static files.

## üì° Flow Overview

```plaintext
User Query (natural language)
    ‚Üì
LLM (via LM Studio)
    ‚Üí Extract structured JSON based on aggregated schema from service contracts
    ‚Üì
ChromaDB Lookup
    ‚Üí Find candidate services and their metadata/contracts
    ‚Üì
Dependency Resolver
    ‚Üí Sort services using topological sort based on input/output contract
    ‚Üì
Service Execution Loop
    ‚Üí Inject resolved values, POST to services, update shared context
    ‚Üì
Logging
    ‚Üí Each execution (or skip) is logged to a shared trace log
```

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Bootstrapping ChromaDB

```bash
cd chroma-agents
docker build -t chroma-bootstrap .
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/app chroma-bootstrap \
    --source /app \
    --host <chroma-host> \
    --port 8000 \
    --collection services
```

Or locally:

```bash
python bootstrap_chroma.py --source . --host localhost --port 8000 --collection services
```

### 2. Coordinator Agent (FastAPI)

Make sure LM Studio is running with the correct `/v1/chat/completions` and embedding endpoint exposed.

```bash
cd coordinator_agent
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7000
```

Environment variables:
```env
LMSTUDIO_URL=http://localhost:1234
chat_model=swe-dev-32b-i1
embed_model=text-embedding-all-minilm-l12-v2
CHROMA_AGENTS_URL=http://chroma-services:8000
SERVICE_SELECTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT=coordinator_agent/prompts/serviceSelectionSystem.txt
SERVICE_SELECTION_USER_PROMPT=coordinator_agent/prompts/serviceSelectionUser.txt
```

## üõ† Example Request

POST `/dispatch`:

```json
{
  "query": "Find me an SUV for a premium customer in Munich",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "id": "rental-service",
      "document": "Rental service provides vehicle availability.",
      "metadata": {
        "endpoint": "http://rental:7001/availability",
        "contract_input": "{...}",
        "contract_output": "{...}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìé Trace Example

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-18T13:05:26.635900",
  "service": "coordinator-agent",
  "correlation_id": "abc-123",
  "request": {
    "location": "MUC"
  },
  "response": {
    "vehicle_type": "SUV"
  },
  "target_service": "rental-service",
  "reason": "executed after dependency resolution",
  "query": "Find me an SUV..."
}
```

## üì¶ Future Ideas

- [ ] Frontend Trace Viewer with Mermaid or JSON diff
- [ ] Semantic service recommendation
- [ ] Streaming or step-by-step service execution visualization
- [ ] Model switching support
